    Copyright 1998 Garrett D'Amore <garrett@yavin.org>

    This package is distributed under the terms of the perl
    Artistic License, a copy of which is included in this distribution.

    This is a module for accessing CCSO-style Ph nameservers.
    These directory servers are common at many universities, and
    certain nameless mail applications come with builtin clients.

    This module should install pretty much like any other Perl5 module.
    No compiler is required.

    1) run "perl Makefile.PL"
    2) run "make"
    3) run "make install"
    4) see the internal pod documentation for details about using Ph.pm.
